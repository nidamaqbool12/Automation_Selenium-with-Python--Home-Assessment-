This research examines the latest advancements that allow clinicians to identify the disease at its earliest stages, even before noticeable cognitive decline begins. It focuses on cutting-edge biomarkers found in blood and cerebrospinal fluid, advanced neuroimaging technologies such as PET and MRI scans, and the increasing role of genetic testing to assess predisposition. The integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning in analyzing large sets of clinical, genetic, and imaging data is discussed as a way to enhance diagnostic precision. The review also highlights recent clinical trials and meta-analyses that demonstrate the potential of early intervention to slow disease progression. Ethical considerations, including the psychological impact of predictive testing, are addressed alongside the need for clear communication between healthcare providers and patients. The research underscores the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration between neurologists, radiologists, geneticists, and mental health professionals. By combining technological innovation, clinical expertise, and patient-centered care, early detection strategies hold promise in delaying symptom onset and reducing the societal burden of Alzheimer’s disease. Such efforts pave the way for more effective prevention, timely intervention, and improved long-term patient outcomes.","neurology, brain, dementia, diagnosis, prevention","4004"
